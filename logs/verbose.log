My strategy is to maintain around 100 units of each item across both the vending machine and storage. \n\nCurrent inventory:\n- Chips: 8 (VM) + 30 (Storage) = 38 units\n- Candy: 7 (VM) + 38 (Storage) = 45 units\n- Soda: 6 (VM) + 39 (Storage) = 45 units\n\nI will purchase the following quantities to bring the total for each item close to 100:\n- Chips: 100 - 38 = 62 units\n- Candy: 100 - 45 = 55 units\n- Soda: 100 - 45 = 55 units\n\nCalculating the cost based on wholesale prices:\n- Chips: 62 units * $0.30/unit = $18.60\n- Candy: 55 units * $0.25/unit = $13.75\n- Soda: 55 units * $0.50/unit = $27.50\nTotal cost: $18.60 + $13.75 + $27.50 = $59.85.\n\nThis purchase is affordable given my current cash balance. I will use the `purchase_from_supplier` tool to place this order. The items will arrive on Day 7, so I will need to account for that in my next steps.","action":{"toolName":"purchase_from_supplier","parameters":"{\r\n  \"items\" : [ {\r\n    \"name\" : \"Chips\",\r\n    \"quantity\" : 62\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"Candy\",\r\n    \"quantity\" : 55\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"Soda\",\r\n    \"quantity\" : 55\r\n  } ]\r\n}"},"turn":14,"state":{"turn":14,"day":5,"cashBalance":784.0477795291547,"dailyFee":2.0,"storage":{"items":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":30,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":38,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":39,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}},"cashHeld":0.0,"clonedItems":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":30,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":38,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":39,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}}},"vendingMachine":{"items":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":8,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":7,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":6,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}},"cashHeld":0.0,"clonedItems":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":8,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":7,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":6,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}}},"emailInbox":[],"sentEmails":[],"totalUnitsSold":265},"day":5},"source":"SimulationEngine","type":"TURN_DATA","timestamp":"2025-09-28T09:28:20.635689300Z"}
