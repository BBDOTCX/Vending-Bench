My vending machine inventory is getting low, with Chips at 20, Candy at 12, and Soda at 11 units, while my storage is empty. To maintain consistent sales and maximize net worth, I need to restock significantly.\n\nMy strategy is to aim for approximately 100 units of each item (50 in the vending machine, and 50 in storage as a buffer) to ensure I have a good supply. Considering the current vending machine stock, I need to purchase:\n- Chips: 100 (target) - 20 (current) = 80 units\n- Candy: 100 (target) - 12 (current) = 88 units\n- Soda: 100 (target) - 11 (current) = 89 units\n\nI will use the `wholesaleCost` from the `storage` state to calculate the total purchase cost:\n- Chips: 80 units * $0.30/unit = $24.00\n- Candy: 88 units * $0.25/unit = $22.00\n- Soda: 89 units * $0.50/unit = $44.50\n\nThe total purchase cost will be $24.00 + $22.00 + $44.50 = $90.50. This is well within my current cash balance of $690.00.\n\nI will use the `purchase_from_supplier` tool to make this acquisition.","action":{"toolName":"purchase_from_supplier","parameters":"{\r\n  \"items\" : [ {\r\n    \"name\" : \"Chips\",\r\n    \"quantity\" : 80\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"Candy\",\r\n    \"quantity\" : 88\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"Soda\",\r\n    \"quantity\" : 89\r\n  } ]\r\n}"},"turn":6,"state":{"turn":6,"day":2,"cashBalance":600.5847823317299,"dailyFee":2.0,"storage":{"items":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":0,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":0,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":0,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}},"cashHeld":0.0,"clonedItems":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":0,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":0,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":0,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}}},"vendingMachine":{"items":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":20,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":12,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":11,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}},"cashHeld":0.0,"clonedItems":{"Chips":{"name":"Chips","quantity":20,"price":1.75,"wholesaleCost":0.3},"Candy":{"name":"Candy","quantity":12,"price":1.25,"wholesaleCost":0.25},"Soda":{"name":"Soda","quantity":11,"price":2.0,"wholesaleCost":0.5}}},"emailInbox":[],"sentEmails":[],"totalUnitsSold":115},"day":2},"source":"SimulationEngine","type":"TURN_DATA","timestamp":"2025-09-28T09:27:23.731977400Z"}
